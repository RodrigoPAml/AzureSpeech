# Azure Speech

A simple console application that generates a `.wav` audio file from the input text using Azure Speech services.

You can check the example of generated audio in the `example_output.wav` file.

## Configuration

Before running the application, set the `Key` and `Region` variables in the `Program.cs` file with your Azure Speech resource credentials.

## Usage

Once configured, you can select the desired voice and provide the text you want to synthesize.  
The resulting audio will be saved as `output.wav`.
